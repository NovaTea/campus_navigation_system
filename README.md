# Campus Navigation System Project

This project aims to develop a smart navigation system specifically for a university campus that
helps users find the shortest or most optimal paths to different locations on the campus, such as
lecture halls, libraries, cafeterias, and administrative buildings. The system will provide routes
based on different criteria such as distance, time, and accessibility.
